### Useage
If you would like to download the emojis of a specific server, go into the sever and find a channel you can type in and type .b  
If you would like to download the emojis from ALL of the servers you are in, you can type .ba in any channel on discord, including DM's.

### Settings
Edit `settings.json`
```
{
  "token":"Token_Here", // Replace Token_Here with your user token.
  "command_prefix":".", // This is the command prefix for your trigger commands(.b, .ba)
  "keep_dir":"false", // If this value is set to true it will append emojis to the folders rather than mirroring backups.
  "no_dupes":"true" // If this value is set to true it will filter duplicate emojis using SHA1 checksums.
}
```
